# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji 

<span class='firstletter'>I</span>'m a self taught programmer that have work in data science for data analysis and deep learning projects.<br/>

I code primarily in Javascript(React) in web development, have worked a few freelance projects for startup <a href='https://www.scachess.com/'>SCA</a> and <a href='https://www.mjus-shoes.com/'> MUJS Shoes</a>. <br/>

I committed myself to data science since 2018, since then I mainly code on Python and practice myself to follow design pattern, clean code principle. Abstraction and logic of code is my interests. 
<hr>
On chill time, I'm a biker and mountain explorer üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I contribute to open source project, read tech blogs (a lot) to help update my knowledge. I log what I found interesting to read on <a href='https://github.com/Chloejay/anti-tldr'>repo</a>. Sometimes I write article, usually is about new tools I experiment or some bugs I struggled, so write to help myself to understand. <br/>

I originally come from consulting, project management background and learnt language and political economics in Shanghai and Nice, France.

### Projects
Here's a brief summary of projects both from work and personal experiments, you can find more on my <a href='https://github.com/Chloejay'>Github profile</a>.
<li>Genetsis ETL: use NodeJS Loopback API, Mysql to build ETL data pipeline for e-commerce brand Delta in-house analytic usage, learnt automate it by using Cron </li>
<li>Overhand Fitness: activities classification model, comparing traditional model KNN, random forest, mainly using library scikit learn (community project)</li>
<li>Coca cola object detection: using Tensorflow framework for object detetcion model to build the mismatch dashboard tool with AWS EC2, S3 and PowerBI</li>
<li>Blockchain Binance: build big data pipeline, building simple DWH NoSQL and SQL, analytical layer, dashboarding use Superset, deployment use Nginx in AWS EC2 platform</li>

###### My Data science journey <br/>

As I have talked to some of my dev friends, <strong>CS is the field can be self study, even though it's hard.</strong> Since 2018, I studied full time for half year to learn basic computer science theory, data structure, modeling and more python. I have gained much support from communities, one community I got involved is <a href='https://www.opentechschool.org/'>OpenTechSchool</a> based in Berlin, Germany. Later I got my first project experience from community CoderBunker to work with experienced data engineers and programmers. <br/>

I gained experience and industrial insights from each project and work. I'm lucky enough to have an opportunity to sharpen my skill to work for the coolest things in deep learning field, which is an R&D project related about `object detection` for Coca Cola Japan in a Dutch startup. On this end-to-end DL project, I take responsibility to build logo detection model from data labeling to model training, inference and deployment in AWS (EC2) build environment, which helps me understand how to design DS project in cloud and a agile workflow. <br/>  -->
