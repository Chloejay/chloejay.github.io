# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji 
<span class='firstletter'>I</span>'m a project and consultant turned programmer, passionate about functional programming and big data. Since 2018, I worked data science in startup firms, my day involves analysis with Python and SQL, dashboard, deep learning and ETL.<br/>

I code Python and Scala, interested in contributing to open source projects. Have a look <a href='https://github.com/Chloejay/anti-tldr'>anti-tldr</a> for some interesting stuff I read. 

Before 2018, I have programmed bit HTML, CSS, Javascript(React), worked two freelance projects for startups <a href='https://www.scachess.com/'>SCA</a> and <a href='https://www.mjus-shoes.com/'> MUJS Shoes</a> as a frontend and wordpress dev.<br/>

<hr>
When I'm not coding, you can find me biking üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Sometimes I write [blog](https://chloejay.github.io/blog/) and [medium][medium] to share comprehension about something I'm enthusiastic about, usually is about new tools I experiment or some bugs I debug. Or some Category Theory I recently start to study.<br/>

I study language and political economics in Shanghai and Nice, France.
