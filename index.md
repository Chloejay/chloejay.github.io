# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji 

I'm a self taught programmer who have work in data science for data analysis and deep learning projects. 

I code primarily in Javascript(Reactjs) for web development, I have worked a few freelance projects for startup <a href='https://www.scachess.com/'>SCA</a> and <a href='https://www.mjus-shoes.com/'> MUJS Shoes</a>. To commit myself to data science since 2018, I mainly code on Python and practice myself to follow design pattern and clean code principle. I love the abstraction and logic for the language. 
<br/>

### Projects
Here's a brief summary of projects both from work and personal experiments, you can find more on my <a href='https://github.com/Chloejay'>Github profile</a>.
<!-- <blockquote> <small>Note: code I wrote belonged to company project and with signed NDA, which any code and details related not included.</small></blockquote> -->
<li>Genetsis ETL: use NodeJS Loopback API, Mysql to build ETL data pipeline for e-commerce brand Delta in-house analytic usage, learnt automate it by using Cron </li>
<li>Overhand Fitness: activities classification model, comparing traditional model KNN, random forest, mainly using library scikit learn (community project)</li>
<li>Coca cola object detection: using Tensorflow framework for object detetcion model to build the mismatch dashboard tool with AWS EC2, S3 and PowerBI</li>
<li>Blockchain Binance: build big data pipeline, building simple DWH NoSQL and SQL, analytical layer, dashboarding use Superset, deployment use Nginx in AWS EC2 platform</li>

### Personal Experimental
<li>Airflow: automating data pipeline<a href=''> [link]</a></li>
<li>Kafka: pub/sub<a href=''> [link]</a></li>

#### <span class='info'><strong>More about me</strong></span> <br/>
###### <My Data science journey:> <br>

As I have talked to some of my dev friends, <strong>CS is the field can be self study, even though it's hard.</strong> Since 2018, I studied full time for half year to learn basic computer science theory, data structure, modeling and more python. I have gained much support from communities, one community I got involved is <a href='https://www.opentechschool.org/'>OpenTechSchool</a> based in Berlin, Germany. Later I got my first project experience from community CoderBunker to work with experienced data engineers and programmers. <br/>

I gained experience and industrial insights from each project and work. I'm lucky enough to have an opportunity to sharpen my skill to work for the coolest things in deep learning field, which is an R&D project related about `object detection` for Coca Cola Japan in a Dutch startup. On this end-to-end DL project, I take responsibility to build logo detection model from data labeling to model training, inference and deployment in AWS (EC2) build environment, which helps me understand how to design DS project in cloud and a agile workflow. <br/> 

I originally come from consulting, project management background and learnt language and political economics in Shanghai and Nice, France. <br/>

###### <My hobby:> 
On chill time, I'm a biker and mountain explorer. I like open source, and read tech blogs (a lot) to help update my knowledge. Recently I made one <a href='https://github.com/Chloejay/anti-tldr'>repo</a> to log what I feel interesting to read. I also like to write code, usually article is about the new tool I experimented and some bugs I struggled, so write to help myself to understand.
