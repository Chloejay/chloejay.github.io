# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji

I'm a self taught programmer who started to learn coding on the 2017 for web dev, and fully commited myself into data science in the beginning of 2018, spent half year to learning basic computer science and python language. Starting to learn from the community, the first community I get involved is the OpenTechSchool based in Berlin, Germany. Later I gained my first project experience from the community CoderBunker. I'm lucky enough to have the opportunity to work the coolest things in the deep learning field for the object detection in a Dutch startup. 

## Projects
Here's a brief summary of my personal projects, you can find more on my Github page.
