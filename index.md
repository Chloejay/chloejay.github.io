# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji 
<a id="theme-toggle" onclick="modeSwitcher()"></a>
<span class='firstletter'>I</span>'m a self taught programmer that I have gained experience for working data analysis and deep learning projects in data science field.<br/>

I mainly code Python since 2018, contribute to open source projects. I like programming in Scala, read tech blogs (\*a lot *\) to help update my knowledge. Have a look about <a href='https://github.com/Chloejay/anti-tldr'>repo anti-tldr</a> for some interesting stuff I read. 

I programmed primarily in HTML, CSS, Javascript(React) for web development before 2018, worked freelance projects for startups <a href='https://www.scachess.com/'>SCA</a> and <a href='https://www.mjus-shoes.com/'> MUJS Shoes</a> as frontend and wordpress dev.<br/>

On chill time, I'm a biker and mountain hiker üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Sometimes I write [blog](https://chloejay.github.io/blog/) and [medium][medium] to share comprehension about something I have passion to explore, usually is about new tools I experiment or some bugs I struggle with.<br/>

I originally worked in consulting and project management, study language and political economics in Shanghai and Nice, France.
