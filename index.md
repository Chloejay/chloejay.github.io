# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji 

I'm a self taught programmer who started to teach myself coding since 2017 (after day time work), dove into front end web development before Python. I've been experimented with Javascript (Reactjs) and Wordpress, worked for a few freelance projects for startup <a href='https://www.scachess.com/'>SCA</a> and <a href='https://www.mjus-shoes.com/'> MUJS Shoes</a>.
<br/>

Interested abstraction and logic of programming language made me eager to stay on this area, though it's a long way to go still. I took a brave leap to fully committed myself into data science starting from beginning of 2018, during which I spent half year to learn basic computer science theory, database structure, modeling and more python as a full time learner. As I have talked to some of my dev friends, <strong>CS is the field can be self study, even though it's hard.</strong> <br/>

My self taught journey has gained much support from communities, the one community I got involved is <a href='https://www.opentechschool.org/'>OpenTechSchool</a> based in Berlin, Germany. Later I got my first project experience from the community CoderBunker and worked with experienced engineers and programmers. <br/>

Later to further pursue the data science journey. I'm lucky enough to have an opportunity to work for the coolest things in deep learning field, which is R&D project related about `object detection` for Coca Cola Japan in a Dutch startup. I take responsibility to build an end-to-end project from data labeling to model training, inference and deployment in AWS (EC2) build environment, which helps me understand how to design DS project in cloud and agile workflow. <br/> 


I originally come from consulting, project management background and learnt language and political economics in Shanghai and France. <br/>

During chill time, I'm a biker and mountain explorer. Black coffee and book lover at daytime.
