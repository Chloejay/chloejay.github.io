# Hello, I'm Chloe Ji 

I'm a self taught programmer who started to learn coding in 2017 (every day after work) for front end web development, I've been experimented with Javascript (Reactjs), worked for a few freelance project for startup <a href='https://www.scachess.com/'>SCA</a> and <a href='https://www.mjus-shoes.com/'> MUJS Shoes</a>.

I fully committed myself into data science since beginning of 2018, during which I spent half year to learn basic computer science and python language. My self taught journey has gained much support from the community, the first community I got involved is the <a href='https://www.opentechschool.org/'>OpenTechSchool</a> based in Berlin, Germany. Later I gained my first project experience from the community CoderBunker. I'm lucky enough to have an opportunity to work the coolest things in deep learning field for the `object detection` in a Dutch based startup. From this end-to-end project I gained a big picture about how to design the data science project from the data labeling to model training, inference and deployment in AWS build environment. 


I originally come from the consulting and project management background. During the chill time, I'm a crazy biker and mountain explorer. Black coffee and book lover at daytime.
