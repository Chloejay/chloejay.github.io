For a reason to connect with why when writing this one, I felt I have bit of ideas but just don't know what is it (Yet!). Maybe the key point I want to express, that code writing should well manage components to put right components in the right place. I started pick up syntax and semantics recently, which to be honest attracted me. For this topic relates to logic, mathematics, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, and maybe other fields. Like arts meets sciences, the beauty exists between its relation. 

Computation language is about rules; algorithm is about logic plus control, though writing is full of creativity, the frame of the pattern and rules need to be obeyed, so 
that code can be passed the compiler for execution and evaluation. Like the natural language writing which combines grammar, in computing language is in relevant to syntax and semantics, which are interconnected to fully construct a "sentence", but both work separately on its own duty. The semantic of language decides which sentence is meaningful and which is non-sense, syntax determines the correct form of the sentence. Either one can't be completed if missing the other.

In details, syntax is contributing to build the structure of the sentence upon components by the composition, be it logic/arithmetic operator, block/function, boolean, etc. Each components built from an atomic level then expanding by increasing its size, or grouping other elements to be representation as a compound object. 

Here to me, is quite an interesting concept, that we actually have a collection of component categories when starting constructing, this is the first level material. Inside the abstract categories, we have declaration, type, operator, command, expression. Then for each category can be varied into its sub category, such as operator have logical operator (AND or OR), arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /, =, <=, etc), then these each representation of the sub category can be varied by its style, the way how to display. Upon this point, this is also decided by the language itself, how the way its language was/is designed. 

For all the tokens needed to pass rules set by the compilers, so design the structure of the code as simple as language designed in compiler, should be a way to try, apart from design patterns or style guide, or TDD techniques when constructing codebase. 

But, just thinking the process to vary the components from atomic to enriched level, or reverse the sequence of components construction, which is the process of inference. 
If thinking this process for cooking, then this is the step that cooker should make the ingredients ready before she/he starts make magic feast. For example as potato, it has different representations, from size, to quality, to even the way to cut, etc. Actually how the ingredients be prepared is the structure of the future dish. To complete the dish, we need the behaviors, such as fried, stem, oven it. Behaviors(action) makes differences, apply to life as well.

Behaviors in computation language is the equal to semantics, which contributes the meaning of the "sentence". For without meaning, nothing is worthy to be pursued.
component based way to write the code and of course to abstract enough, to keep it pure. 

Although the concrete is essential to implement the program, the abstract is rooted at the heart of the program about semantic defines. In syntax, it consists abstract syntax and concrete syntax, which is similar to interface and implementation (if I digest/feel right). Abstract is to structure the sentence, which captures the pure structure of the phrases in the language by specifying logical relations between the parts of the language, to be formulated as abstract syntax tree (AST). In a analogy way for natural language, it will be constructed with subject-verb-noun (S-V-N) as basic structure to complete one full sentence. In each main part, we can derive to each sub-category, or sub-sub-category. For Backus-Naur Form (BNF), is just like to make above components to be a sentence structure in a derived and logic way. So even one designed object shared the same BNF, it's not be necessary to share the same meaning, which decided by implementation. Come to code design, would be an idea to create all the base component, its derived one, can be compound, etc, then start to give behaviors to each components, to make them alive by communicating in concrete syntax, think the way that concrete syntax defines the way that program are actually written. So in this sense, writing code is like writing a novel, or also like poem in its abstract level. 

In this sense, expression plays a role for either representation of value and executable computation for static and dynamic expression respectively. In each expression, it express the thoughts(logic) of a programmer, can be predicate, reduction to go to the end of the path, proof.  

So this is also the importance to know one language well, need to know its all the idiom, existed data structure, so that manage these components in a better (experienced) manner. 

Also language another format is music, life without music is boring. Think about it why?
