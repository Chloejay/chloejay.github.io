Time flies, if I don't pay attention, I did miss it. 2020 is an interesting year, adventure.
<<<<<<< HEAD
I have taught in coding community for the summer two month, solo biked to Mogan Mount for 400 KM, if say what I have accomplished on my 2020 resolution list, I only have this two among ten.

Review my whole journey, who I'd still thank most is Oscar, from him I get more than help for DS but encouragement, so that I can take the courage to move forward.
