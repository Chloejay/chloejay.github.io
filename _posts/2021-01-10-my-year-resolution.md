<div markdown="1" id="text">
Time flies, if I don't pay attention, I did miss it. 2020 is an interesting year, adventure.
I have taught in coding community for the summer two month, solo biked to Mogan Mount for 400 KM, if say what I have accomplished on my 2020 resolution list, I only have this two among ten.

Review my whole journey, who I'd still thank most is Oscar, from him I get more than help for DS but encouragement, so that I can take the courage to move forward.

So what the goal I would set, 
- Continue to take courage for adventure
- Contribute to open source by using Python language
- Pass Kafka Exam for certification
- Improve my coding skill for FP code
- Learn a new language: -> Java
- Blog once a month
- Read one book per month
- Learn a new hobby, Union[dance, boxing]
- Change my current job, I'd like to work a job fully programming base
- Go for a solo trip
