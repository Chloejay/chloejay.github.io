<div markdown="1" id="text">
Since last month, I have been looking for job for 40 days, applying since May holiday. I got interviews, one is with Zoom, one is on-site whiteboard, technical one, one is told me I passed for 1st round, but my interests to continue with that role is low, I reply to say I would like to stop the applying process, why try if that role is not linked to my career pursuit, even in the end I got the job I would not work extreme hard like chasing my dream, one is the founder is still stuck in EU, so she can't come back to Shanghai within few months, so even got hired, the role is part time etc.

Applying, checking if any new job posts, preparing interviews makes me work as a full time job seeker, it's an interesting (stressful) tasks. Loads of rejections or just no replies also discouraged me and lead me to heavy self doubt, if I just learnt nothing from my past one year.

For the reason you don't have the CS degree is one of the most received feedbacks I had. Yes I'm a career changer since 2018, I only have bachelor of arts degree, studied of language and political economy. But I worked hard to learn something enough to start as a data analyst, then strive to deep learning field as a junior data scientist(this role I started from a data scientist trainee, quite an adventure, so I put all myself in, this journey in the end taught me a lot).

I stopped to send any resumes for one more week, but spend time to learn more about data structure and algorithms, for I failed on that whiteboard, my little confidence gone as well(I got lost on street when I finished my interview). Nothing is left but my shadow. Learning on Coursera is an entertainment for me now, seemed to pass this course can gain back the confidence I had before.

I do have learnt more patterns from algorithms, especially try to understand a new concept `dynamic programming` and `stress test`, try to design thinking flow by pen and paper before jumping to write code.

I prepared technical interviews, by more practice I believe I can perform better on my next interviews. Giving up is not my part of character, for I'm an extremist. I will put double efforts to apply companies I want to work with, and at the same time continue learning. I will teach data science in Le Wagon on this month, I believe this is also a wonderful experience for me to share what I already experienced with new learners, besides always take a new beginner way of thinking to see the DS world.
