One word for what I was doing on this week, I started to apply for jobs again, have more interviews, so not so that scare and hopeless. I pushed myself to walk out my comfortable zone(beat my imposter syndrome), to talk with new strangers, then turned out I made new friends.

I'm appreciated the way time runs (even I know time itself, just one dimension or should not be existed as the way we called), I met my previous boss and friend on <i>Women Who Code</i> event in IKEA.

For twitter I followed most are Scala community, yeah I know I fall for this language since I picked up, by learning this new language, it connected some dots and holes on my dark sides. Even language is just a tool to solve business and tech problem, so no preach or religion here, just my human feeling when entering a new door. More exploratory about type theory and Monad is on the way. (I choose pause, focus on practicing Python since failed on whiteboard code interview.)

Back to tweet, "not all the good programmers are started at childhood" makes me feel more encouraged. Yes there is one chance awaits me, for sure.
