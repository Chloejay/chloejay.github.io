<div markdown="1" id="text">
I write a poem in kaffe shop. <br/>
Chase stars in darkness without sound and light;<br/>
which touches me into the deep of hole, the shallow of my heart;<br/>
Move around try to grasp a paper to write down something;<br/>
Found I lose the words. <br/>

Have a deep dream recently;<br/>
I had a deep conversation with a lovely girl;<br/>
We laughed together;<br/>
when I tried to find her back;<br/>
I found nowhere;<br/>
Only hearing whispers from the book at my hand;<br/>
But I don't know which page she is;<br/>
I can't find her back.<br/>

Biking; <br/>
Waiting on traffic light, starting recall this dream;<br/>
oh I see, life is like this;<br/>
It's gone when you miss the good old part;<br/>
I continue biking.<br/>
