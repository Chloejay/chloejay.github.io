I looked at the windows side of Kaffee shop when waiting for my food, the meoment I feel the world is so amazing and beautiful. 
That moment I'm so grateful to tell myself I'm glad where I have travelled. I can call it a journey I have to travel. It was a journey, indeed. When I come back home, I read the poem `The Journey` wrote by <i><b>Mary Oliver</b></i>. I have been the fan of her for some time, but until today when I read her poem, I never feel so much connected. I know poem is always connected to the soul, which is a gift for the human spiritual world. But today I deeply feel poem is the way of living, the live we for words. 

>One day you finally knew 
>what you had to do, and 
>began, 
>though the voices around you 
>kept shouting
>their bad advice -- 
>though the whole house 
>began to tremble
>and you felt the old tug 
>at your ankles. 
>"Mend my life!"
>each voice cried. 
>But you didn't stop. 
>You knew what you had to
>do, 
>though the wind pried
>with its stiff fingers 
>at the very foundations,
>though their melancholy 
>was terrible. 
>It was already late 
>enough, and a wild night, 
>and the road full of fallen
>branches and stones. 
>But little by little, 
>as you left their voice behind, 
>the stars began to burn 
>through the sheets of clouds,
>and there was a new voice 
>which you slowly 
>recognized as your own, 
>that kept you company
>as you strode deeper and 
>deeper
>into the world,
>determined to do 
>the only thing you could do -- 
>determined to save 
>the only life you could 
>save. 

I have been feed with good words recently, be it the programming words, and goodreads. All I can wish is just let the good words stay with me, to continue the journey.
