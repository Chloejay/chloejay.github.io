I looked at the windows side of Kaffee shop when waiting for my food, the meoment I feel the world is so amazing and beautiful. 
That moment I'm so grateful to tell myself I'm glad where I have travelled. I can call it a journey I have to travel. It was a journey, indeed. When I come back home, I read the poem `The Journey` wrote by <i><b>Mary Oliver</b></i>. I have been the fan of her for some time, but until today when I read her poem, I never feel so much connected. I know poem is always connected to the soul, which is a gift for the human spiritual world. But today I deeply feel poem is the way of living, the live we for words. 

>One day you finally knew <br/>
>what you had to do, and <br/>
>began, <br/>
>though the voices around you <br/>
>kept shouting <br/>
>their bad advice -- <br/>
>though the whole house <br/>
>began to tremble <br/>
>and you felt the old tug <br/>
>at your ankles. <br/>
>"Mend my life!" <br/>
>each voice cried. <br/>
>But you didn't stop. <br/>
>You knew what you had to <br/>
>do, <br/>
>though the wind pried <br/>
>with its stiff fingers <br/>
>at the very foundations,<br/>
>though their melancholy <br/>
>was terrible. <br/>
>It was already late <br/>
>enough, and a wild night, <br/>
>and the road full of fallen <br/>
>branches and stones. <br/>
>But little by little, <br/>
>as you left their voice behind, <br/>
>the stars began to burn <br/>
>through the sheets of clouds,<br/>
>and there was a new voice <br/>
>which you slowly <br/>
>recognized as your own, <br/>
>that kept you company <br/>
>as you strode deeper and <br/>
>deeper <br/>
>into the world,<br/>
>determined to do <br/>
>the only thing you could do -- <br/>
>determined to save <br/>
>the only life you could <br/>
>save. <br/>

I have been feed with good words recently, be it the programming words, and goodreads. All I can wish is just let the good words stay with me, to continue the journey.
