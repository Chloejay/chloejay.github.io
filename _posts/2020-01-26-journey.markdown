<div markdown="1" id="text">

Life is not about happiness, but something above which is exploring the human capacity and feeling the full range of emotions with body functions we all gifted with. Walking far away from somewhere with dirty feet, which brings back a wonderful story, getting hands dirty to build a craft, which truly the bliss behind the surface of the convenient happiness. Walk into the nature and after <strong>solo biking for 200KM</strong> this week. Nature itself is the perfect algorithm, but for the individual life that pass by for a short span, life. If we have been giving too much from the universe, maybe our life in this world is giving. I believe it. Giving is not the comfort zone, for we must need to create the value which can be giving back to the universe. It will be a hard and uncomfortable path, but a worthy and exploring journey, which is the true happiness indeed.
