short_description: create data engineering course, long-distance biking

<div markdown="1" id="text">
It's been a week more from my bike ride, total 400KM from Shanghai to Mogan Mount, it was a journey I always look for, to ride far away, then take back a filtered me. I give this activity a verb `purify` and I know I need this to fill my human heart, for at end of each day I'm not the machine I work on, I'm the human, broken and flawed, emotional... but all happened just is true, then is beautiful.

Long distance provided me a perfect isolated movable space, lonely when cycled in the darkness, fear when I have no battery but still 30KM far from my destination (hotel), uncertain when most streets in Mogan Shan town have no street lights, so I need to bike towards but have not sure if I'm biking in a right direction and how far still... Started setoff at 5AM, so when 8PM I was cycling in a remote mountain surrounded town, I was hungry.

However it was time to generate memory, similar to assist teaching DS this summer, two students are inspired me (their hard works and curiosities).

#### Work on progress
So in this September, I make an decision to create myself a data engineering course, I have made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KvcmVE3QwSpB90zFrIa1QUAcAGwIag5BwD5bmnrcfR8/edit?usp=sharing">checklist</a>. I have asked one virtual friend I trust (whose encouragement and advice notes helped me a lot last year when I started DL journey), he mentioned Airflow and Kafka for automating workflow and streaming processing. So some work used these tools I will write on next post.
